# sefi - SEnd FIles
## instructions

You must have python and git installed. Open your terminal program of choice and move to the directory you would like to install to.
Then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/siathema/sefi.git
```
Next run sefi with the directory of your choosing to generate a jason file for sefi:
```
./sefi [Path to directory]
```

If you want to have cron run it every 4 hours at half past the hour then first change your VISUAL enviroment variable to nano:
```
export VISUAL=nano
```

This makes it easier to edit using crontab:
```
crontab -e
```   
    
Add this entry to your contab file:
```
MAILTO=user@example.com                                                         
30 0,4,8,16,20 * * * path-to-sefi/sefi.py path-to-directory   
```
